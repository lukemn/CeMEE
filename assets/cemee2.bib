              allele frequency data. Our approach seems to be the first that is
              able to estimate more than one haplotype given such data. Even
              the accuracy of experimentally obtained allele frequencies can be
              improved by re-estimating them from our reconstructed haplotypes.
              Reconstructing haplotypes from sequencing data is of interest to
              several areas of biological and medical research. In evolutionary
              genetics, for instance, haplotypes help to better understand the
              genetic architecture of adaptation. Here we consider genomic time
              series data from three evolve and re-sequence experiments as an
              application. However, the approach can in principle be used in a
              wider context, as only data from multiple samples are needed, not

               Evolutionary theory suggests that phenotypic stasis is explained by natural
               selection and genetic drift, or by constraints imposed by
               mutation and recombination of standing genetic variation. We
               performed experimental evolution from standing genetic variation
               with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, measuring individual
               locomotion in outcrossing populations for 240 generations. We
               find that, in our constant environment, locomotion bias shows no
               directional divergence, due to both stabilizing and disruptive
               selection on specific combinations of component traits. Despite
               phenotypic stasis, the genetic variance-covariance structure
               between component traits shows clear divergence from the
               ancestral state and extensive differentiation among replicated

               accumulation experiments and genome-sequenced recombinant inbred

  abstract = "All organisms live in temporally fluctuating environments. Theory
              predicts that the evolution of deterministic maternal effects
              (i.e., anticipatory maternal effects or transgenerational
              phenotypic plasticity) underlies adaptation to environments that
              fluctuate in a predictably alternating fashion over
              maternal-offspring generations. In contrast, randomizing maternal
              effects (i.e., diversifying and conservative bet-hedging), are
              expected to evolve in response to unpredictably fluctuating
              environments. Although maternal effects are common, evidence for
              their adaptive significance is equivocal since they can easily
              evolve as a correlated response to maternal selection and may or
              may not increase the future fitness of offspring. Using the
              hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we here show that
              the experimental evolution of maternal glycogen provisioning
              underlies adaptation to a fluctuating normoxia-anoxia hatching
              environment by increasing embryo survival under anoxia. In
              strictly alternating environments, we found that hermaphrodites
              evolved the ability to increase embryo glycogen provisioning when
              they experienced normoxia and to decrease embryo glycogen
              provisioning when they experienced anoxia. At odds with existing
              theory, however, populations facing irregularly fluctuating
              normoxia-anoxia hatching environments failed to evolve
              randomizing maternal effects. Instead, adaptation in these
              populations may have occurred through the evolution of fitness
              effects that percolate over multiple generations, as they
              maintained considerably high expected growth rates during
              experimental evolution despite evolving reduced fecundity and
              reduced embryo survival under one or two generations of anoxia.
              We develop theoretical models that explain why adaptation to a
              wide range of patterns of environmental fluctuations hinges on
              the existence of deterministic maternal effects, and that such
              deterministic maternal effects are more likely to contribute to
              adaptation than randomizing maternal effects.",

               experimental evolution of hermaphrodite-male (androdioecious)

               changes underlying adaptive shifts in hermaphrodite sex

               early-life self-fertility occurred through modification of a
               suite of developmental traits: increased self-sperm production,
               accelerated oogenesis and ovulation, and increased embryo
               retention. The experimental evolution of increased self-sperm
               production delayed entry into oogenesis---as expected, given the
               sequentially coupled production of self-spermatogenesis and
               oogenesis. Surprisingly, however, delayed oogenesis onset did
               not delay reproductive maturity, nor did it trade-off with

               selfing are partly responsible for the great diversity of animal
               and plant reproduction systems. The hypothesis of `reproductive
               assurance' suggests that transitions to selfing occur because
               selfers that are able to reproduce on their own ensure the
               persistence of populations in environments where mates or
               pollination agents are unavailable. Here we test this hypothesis
               by performing experimental evolution in Caenorhabditis elegans.
               We show that self-compatible hermaphrodites provide reproductive
               assurance to a male-female population facing a novel environment
               where outcrossing is limiting. Invasions of hermaphrodites in
               male-female populations, and subsequent experimental evolution
               in the novel environment, led to successful transitions to
               selfing and adaptation. Adaptation was not due to the loss of
               males during transitions, as shown by evolution experiments in
               exclusively hermaphroditic populations and in male-hermaphrodite
               populations. Instead, adaptation was due to the displacement of
               females by hermaphrodites. Genotyping of single-nucleotide
               polymorphisms further indicated that the observed evolution of
               selfing rates was not due to selection of standing genetic
               diversity. Finally, numerical modelling and evolution
               experiments in male-female populations demonstrate that the
               improvement of male fitness components may diminish the
               opportunity for reproductive assurance. Our findings support the
               hypothesis that reproductive assurance can drive the transition
               from outcrossing to selfing, and further suggest that the
               success of transitions to selfing hinges on adaptation of
               obligate outcrossing populations to the environment where
               outcrossing was once a limiting factor.",

               the evolution of sexual populations to novel environments is
               poorly understood. To address this issue, we studied the impact
               of two mating systems, androdioecy and dioecy, on genotype
               distributions during the experimental evolution of
               Caenorhabditis elegans. We analyzed the temporal trajectories of
               334 single nucleotide polymorphisms, covering 1/3 of the genome,
               and found extensive allele frequency changes and little loss of
               heterozygosities after 100 generations. As modeled with
               numerical simulations, SNP differentiation was consistent with
               genetic drift and average fitness effects of 2\%, assuming that
               selection acted independently at each locus. Remarkably,
               inbreeding by self-fertilization was of little consequence to
               SNP differentiation. Modeling selection on deleterious recessive
               alleles suggests that the initial evolutionary dynamics can be
               explained by associative overdominance, but not the later stages
               because much lower heterozygosities would be maintained during
               experimental evolution. By contrast, models with selection on
               true overdominant loci can explain the heterozygote excess
               observed at all periods, particularly when negative epistasis or
               independent fitness effects were considered. Overall, these

              adaptation to novel environments. For this, we contrasted the
              evolution of a fitness component exclusive to outcrossing in
              experimental populations of different mating systems. We
              introgressed a modifier of outcrossing into a hybrid population
              derived from several wild isolates to transform the wild-type
              androdioecious mating system into a dioecious mating system. By
              genotyping 375 single-nucleotide polymorphisms we show that the
              two populations had similar standing genetic diversity available
              for adaptation, despite the occurrence of selection during their
              derivation. We then performed replicated experimental evolution
              under the two mating systems from starting conditions of either
              high or low levels of diversity, under defined environmental
              conditions of discrete non-overlapping generations, constant
              density at high population sizes (N = 104), no obvious spatial
              structure and abundant food resources. During 100 generations
              measurements of sex ratios and male competitive performance
              showed: 1) adaptation to the novel environment; 2) directional
              selection on male frequency under androdioecy; 3) optimal
              outcrossing rates of 0.5 under androdioecy; 4) the existence of
              initial inbreeding depression; and finally 5) that the strength
              of directional selection on male competitive performance does not
              depend on male frequencies. Taken together, these results suggest
              that androdioecious males are maintained at intermediate
              frequencies because outcrossing is adaptive.",

              functions that are unique to rapid coevolutionary change are
              generally unknown. We here combined experimental evolution of the
              bacterial biocontrol agent Bacillus thuringiensis and its
              nematode host Caenorhabditis elegans with large-scale
              phenotyping, whole genome analysis, and functional genetics to
              demonstrate the selective benefit of pathogen virulence and the
              underlying toxin genes during the adaptation process. We show
              that: (i) high virulence was specifically favoured during
              pathogen-host coevolution rather than pathogen one-sided
              adaptation to a nonchanging host or to an environment without
              host; (ii) the pathogen genotype BT-679 with known nematocidal
              toxin genes and high virulence specifically swept to fixation in
              all of the independent replicate populations under coevolution
              but only some under one-sided adaptation; (iii) high virulence in
              the BT-679-dominated populations correlated with elevated copy
              numbers of the plasmid containing the nematocidal toxin genes;
              (iv) loss of virulence in a toxin-plasmid lacking BT-679 isolate
              was reconstituted by genetic reintroduction or external addition

              self-fertilization as a result of genetic exchange between
              genetically variable individuals. Such genetic exchange may
              increase the efficacy of selection by breaking down
              Hill-Robertson interference, as well as promoting the maintenance
              of within-lineage genetic diversity. Experimental studies have
              demonstrated the selective advantage of outcrossing in novel
              environments. Here, we assess the specific role of genetic
              variation in the evolution of outcrossing. We experimentally
              evolved genetically variable and inbred populations of mixed
              mating (outcrossing and self-fertilizing) Caenorhabditis elegans
              nematodes under novel ecological conditions-specifically the
              presence of the virulent parasite Serratia marcescens.
              Outcrossing rates increased in genetically variable host
              populations evolved in the presence of the parasite, whereas
              parasite exposure in inbred populations resulted in reduced rates
              of host outcrossing. The host populations with genetic variation
              also exhibited increased fitness in the presence of the parasite
              over eight generations, whereas inbred populations did not. This
              increase in fitness was primarily the result of adaptation to the
              parasite, rather than recovery from initial inbreeding
              depression. Therefore, the benefits of outcrossing were only
              manifested in the presence of genetic variation, and outcrossing
              was favored over self-fertilization as a result. As predicted,
              the benefits of outcrossing under novel ecological conditions are
              a product of genetic exchange between genetically diverse
