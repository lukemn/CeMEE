               Evolutionary theory suggests that phenotypic stasis is explained by natural
               selection and genetic drift, or by constraints imposed by
               mutation and recombination of standing genetic variation. We
               performed experimental evolution from standing genetic variation
               with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, measuring individual
               locomotion in outcrossing populations for 240 generations. We
               find that, in our constant environment, locomotion bias shows no
               directional divergence, due to both stabilizing and disruptive
               selection on specific combinations of component traits. Despite
               phenotypic stasis, the genetic variance-covariance structure
               between component traits shows clear divergence from the
               ancestral state and extensive differentiation among replicated
               populations facing the same environment. Analysis of mutation
               accumulation experiments and genome-sequenced recombinant inbred
               lines from the experimental populations indicates that the
               evolution of the genetic variance-covariance structure is
               independent of de novo mutation or major effect QTL; being
               instead explained by the joint action of selection and drift in
               generating subtle linkage disequilibrium differences between
               small effect QTL among replicate populations. These findings
               indicate that phenotypic evolution is repeatable because of
               selection, even if the genetic structuring of component traits
               within lineages is mostly contingent upon drift
               history.",

               Although CeMEE populations are derived from a long-term

  author   = "Dey, Snigdhadip and Proulx, Stephen R and Teot{\'o}nio, Henrique",
  abstract = "All organisms live in temporally fluctuating environments. Theory
              predicts that the evolution of deterministic maternal effects
              (i.e., anticipatory maternal effects or transgenerational
              phenotypic plasticity) underlies adaptation to environments that
              fluctuate in a predictably alternating fashion over
              maternal-offspring generations. In contrast, randomizing maternal
              effects (i.e., diversifying and conservative bet-hedging), are
              expected to evolve in response to unpredictably fluctuating
              environments. Although maternal effects are common, evidence for
              their adaptive significance is equivocal since they can easily
              evolve as a correlated response to maternal selection and may or
              may not increase the future fitness of offspring. Using the
              hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we here show that
              the experimental evolution of maternal glycogen provisioning
              underlies adaptation to a fluctuating normoxia-anoxia hatching
              environment by increasing embryo survival under anoxia. In
              strictly alternating environments, we found that hermaphrodites
              evolved the ability to increase embryo glycogen provisioning when
              they experienced normoxia and to decrease embryo glycogen
              provisioning when they experienced anoxia. At odds with existing
              theory, however, populations facing irregularly fluctuating
              normoxia-anoxia hatching environments failed to evolve
              randomizing maternal effects. Instead, adaptation in these
              populations may have occurred through the evolution of fitness
              effects that percolate over multiple generations, as they
              maintained considerably high expected growth rates during
              experimental evolution despite evolving reduced fecundity and
              reduced embryo survival under one or two generations of anoxia.
              We develop theoretical models that explain why adaptation to a
              wide range of patterns of environmental fluctuations hinges on
              the existence of deterministic maternal effects, and that such
              deterministic maternal effects are more likely to contribute to
              adaptation than randomizing maternal effects.",

               research, yet the developmental processes by which hermaphrodite

               experimental evolution of hermaphrodite-male (androdioecious)
               Caenorhabditis elegans populations to quantify the developmental
               changes underlying adaptive shifts in hermaphrodite sex
               allocation. We show that the experimental evolution of increased
               early-life self-fertility occurred through modification of a
               suite of developmental traits: increased self-sperm production,
               accelerated oogenesis and ovulation, and increased embryo
               retention. The experimental evolution of increased self-sperm
               production delayed entry into oogenesis---as expected, given the
               sequentially coupled production of self-spermatogenesis and
               oogenesis. Surprisingly, however, delayed oogenesis onset did
               not delay reproductive maturity, nor did it trade-off with
               gamete or embryo size. Comparing developmental time dynamics of
               germline and soma indicates that the evolution of increased

  abstract  = "Evolutionary transitions from outcrossing between individuals to
               selfing are partly responsible for the great diversity of animal
               and plant reproduction systems. The hypothesis of `reproductive
               assurance' suggests that transitions to selfing occur because
               selfers that are able to reproduce on their own ensure the
               persistence of populations in environments where mates or
               pollination agents are unavailable. Here we test this hypothesis
               by performing experimental evolution in Caenorhabditis elegans.
               We show that self-compatible hermaphrodites provide reproductive
               assurance to a male-female population facing a novel environment
               where outcrossing is limiting. Invasions of hermaphrodites in
               male-female populations, and subsequent experimental evolution
               in the novel environment, led to successful transitions to
               selfing and adaptation. Adaptation was not due to the loss of
               males during transitions, as shown by evolution experiments in
               exclusively hermaphroditic populations and in male-hermaphrodite
               populations. Instead, adaptation was due to the displacement of
               females by hermaphrodites. Genotyping of single-nucleotide
               polymorphisms further indicated that the observed evolution of
               selfing rates was not due to selection of standing genetic
               diversity. Finally, numerical modelling and evolution
               experiments in male-female populations demonstrate that the
               improvement of male fitness components may diminish the
               opportunity for reproductive assurance. Our findings support the
               hypothesis that reproductive assurance can drive the transition
               from outcrossing to selfing, and further suggest that the
               success of transitions to selfing hinges on adaptation of
               obligate outcrossing populations to the environment where
               outcrossing was once a limiting factor.",

               poorly understood. To address this issue, we studied the impact
               of two mating systems, androdioecy and dioecy, on genotype
               distributions during the experimental evolution of
               Caenorhabditis elegans. We analyzed the temporal trajectories of
               334 single nucleotide polymorphisms, covering 1/3 of the genome,
               and found extensive allele frequency changes and little loss of
               heterozygosities after 100 generations. As modeled with
               numerical simulations, SNP differentiation was consistent with
               genetic drift and average fitness effects of 2\%, assuming that
               selection acted independently at each locus. Remarkably,
               inbreeding by self-fertilization was of little consequence to
               SNP differentiation. Modeling selection on deleterious recessive
               alleles suggests that the initial evolutionary dynamics can be
               explained by associative overdominance, but not the later stages
               because much lower heterozygosities would be maintained during
               experimental evolution. By contrast, models with selection on
               true overdominant loci can explain the heterozygote excess
               observed at all periods, particularly when negative epistasis or
               independent fitness effects were considered. Overall, these
               findings indicate that selection at single loci, including
               purging of recessive alleles, underlies most of the genetic
               differentiation accomplished during the experiment. Nonetheless,
               they also imply that maintenance of genetic diversity may in
               large part be due to balancing selection at multiple loci.",

              adaptation to novel environments. For this, we contrasted the
              evolution of a fitness component exclusive to outcrossing in
              experimental populations of different mating systems. We
              introgressed a modifier of outcrossing into a hybrid population
              derived from several wild isolates to transform the wild-type
              androdioecious mating system into a dioecious mating system. By
              genotyping 375 single-nucleotide polymorphisms we show that the
              two populations had similar standing genetic diversity available
              for adaptation, despite the occurrence of selection during their
              derivation. We then performed replicated experimental evolution
              under the two mating systems from starting conditions of either
              high or low levels of diversity, under defined environmental
              conditions of discrete non-overlapping generations, constant
              density at high population sizes (N = 104), no obvious spatial
              structure and abundant food resources. During 100 generations
              measurements of sex ratios and male competitive performance
              showed: 1) adaptation to the novel environment; 2) directional
              selection on male frequency under androdioecy; 3) optimal
              outcrossing rates of 0.5 under androdioecy; 4) the existence of
              initial inbreeding depression; and finally 5) that the strength
              of directional selection on male competitive performance does not
              depend on male frequencies. Taken together, these results suggest
              that androdioecious males are maintained at intermediate
