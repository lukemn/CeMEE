### CeMEE: Resources for the C. elegans multiparent experimental evolution panel


blah blah

A [genome browser](https://lukemn.github.io/cemee_jbrowse) is available for querying genetic variants in the panel, haplotype reconstructions, as well as various SNP and haplotype-based statistics. Association statistics will eventually be added.

#### RIL metadata

Here we summarise the sequencing status of each recombinant inbred line and link to the raw data in [SRA](). 

####Downloads

Haplotype reconstructions.  

Genome sequence data for founders, RILs, populations (bams on NCBI SRA).  

Raw (or, for behavioural data, minimally processed) phenotype data (text files)

#### Publications
