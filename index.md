# Resources for the *C. elegans* multiparent experimental evolution panel
===========================================================================

This site hosts genotype and phenotype data and associated metadata for the CeMEE panel.

A [genome browser](https://lukemn.github.io/cemee_jbrowse) is available for querying genetic variants in the panel, haplotype reconstructions, as well as various SNP and haplotype-based statistics. Association statistics will eventually be added.

RIL metadata tabulates sequencing status and statistics for each recombinant inbred line and population, with links to the raw data in [NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

Downloads contains links to various forms of raw (or minimally processed) phenotype data, reconstructed haplotypes, and files for use in [R/qtl](http://www.rqtl.org/).
