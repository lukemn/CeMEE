* [Chelo et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3417?origin=ppub) [-@Chelo:2013gf] Testing of frequency-dependent allelic extinction probabilities using two inbred lines derived from [A6140](), one after introgression of an integrated GFP reporter under the *myo-3* promoter.
* [Chelo & Teotonio](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01744.x) [-@Chelo:2013dq] Individual-level genotyping from dioecious and androdioecious populations to study the mode of selection underlying maintenance of genetic diversity during adaptation.
